## WELCOME TO MY PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO üóÇÔ∏è

## Portfolio Home

The portfolio home page was designed with a navigation menu that brings together all the most important sections of the project, all with divs and navs properly marked in the HTML to keep the home page well organized.
In addition, for a better user experience, I also added contrasting colors and images with animations, navigation transitions and animations such as hover on all buttons with a universal class.

## Specialties Page

In the "my specialties" tab I used a section with 5 divs, all of which I styled via CSS to create personalized and animated cards for a better user experience.

## About Page

In the about tab, I kept the code organized, focusing on bringing a bit of my personality and personal presentation, working with the div elements in a structured way and combining the page's design with a beautiful header and footer, with contact buttons for my social networks, my email and a clean logo for this project.

## Projects Page

The projects tab is my favorite and the one I consider the most important of this entire project, since I decided to put my main projects and demonstrate in this section the mastery of the technologies I use. Furthermore, there is a strong connection between this page and my Github, everything on this page is properly hosted and versioned on Github, the principles and code structuring of this page are the same as the others, since I worked with universal classes, so the hover applied to the cards of my skills is the same applied here, avoiding repetitions of the same properties in my code and making it lighter and optimized for web browsers.

## Contact Page

And finally, in the contacts tab I used a forms API to connect with my email, this way everything in this portfolio is functional, if you want to send me a form it will fall into my email box, just fill in the data as the form requests and click on the input button, the 3d icon design I used, I made it so that it would work in all the tabs of my website, and with the same animation using keyframes in CSS, this is my portfolio, it was my first project using HTML5, CSS3 and JS, I hope you liked it, if you want to contact me, all my social networks are synchronized both in my portfolio and in my Github.
